Ansible Deploy Script for Master Portal
###############################################################################


What are these scripts for?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These scripts are for deploying a Master Portal + Credential Store. To find out
more about what this setup is useful for take a look at:
https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/CILogon_Pre-Pilot_Work . You can use these scripts
to deploy a Master Portal and Credential Store on two separate hosts, or into
one single host. 


Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. You need to have host certificates ready for this deployment. Place
	   your PEM formatted  certificate and key file under the
	   '*.PLACEHOLDER' files in the 'roles/basic/files/' directory. The
	   basic role will take care of deploying these into the target machine.
	   It is assumed that your host certificates are issued by 'TERENA
	   eScience SSL CA 3'. If not, you will have to make some modifications
	   to these scripts before executing them!


How to use these scripts?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin executing plays make sure to decide whether you're deployment
will use two separate hosts for Master Portal and Credential Store, or a single
host. Fill in you machine hostname[s] into the 'hosts.inventory' file
accordingly. The hostname[s] set in the invertory files will be set on the
target machine[s].

There are two different plays you can execute. One for the Credential Store
called 'credstore.yml' and one for the Master Portal called 'masterportal.yml'.
Both plays include the basic role, which takes care of setting up the
environment for both components. 

Make sure to check recommanded modifications below before starting either play!
In case of single host deployments, execute 'credstore.yml' first and
'materportal.yml' after. 

1. credstore.yml

	a. Fill in required environment variables

	   This play will configure the Credential Server host. Basically, it
	   provides a MyProxy Server installation with some configuration.
	   Before starting this play there are a couple important variables you
	   should override. You can find these and their explanation in
	   'credstore_env.yml'.

	b. Provide Online CA tar file

	   MyProxy only stores credentials that it can verify, therefor it's
	   very important to have the Online CA (which will issue user
	   certificates) present in the trusted certificates directory (usually
	   /etc/grid-security/certificates). Make a tarball from the Online CA
	   in pem format, together with subject_hash links and signing_policy.
	   Do not forget the signing policy, since MyProxy will not work without
	   it. The result tarball should contain these files at the top level,
	   without any direcotry structure, and it should be places under
	   'roles/credstore/files/'


2. masterportal.yml

	a. Fill in the required environment variables

	   Before executing this play, make sure to fill in the required
	   variables listed and explained in the 'masterportal_env.yml' file.
	   Look into the masterportal_env.yml.tamplate for a list of variables
	   you have to override. 

	b. Verify deploying war files

	   This play is about to deploy the Master Portal war files
	   (mp-oa2-client.war and mp-oa2-server.war) and optionally the VO
	   Portal war file (vo-portal.war). Make sure that these are present in
	   your 'role/masterportal/files' directory. 

	c. Tweak iptables rules

	   There is a simple set of iptable rules being deployed by this play.
	   Feel free to customize this to the needs of your infrastructure. Make
	   sure to leave port 443 accessible. The iptables file can be found in
	   'role/masterportal/files'
