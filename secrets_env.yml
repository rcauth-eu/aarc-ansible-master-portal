# Trust and Key stores

# The keystore is used for BOTH MP Client and MP Server to access the Credential Store
# therefor the two passwords (mp_client_keystore_pw and mp_server_keystore_pw) should be the 
# same. This way the two components can share a single keystore. The keystore usually contains 
# the hostcert of the Master Portal. Levea the following configuration as it is
mp_server_keystore_pw: "{{ mp_client_keystore_pw }}"

# The truststore contains trusted root certificates, and it's used to establish connection
# to the delegation server (/token and /getcert endpoints are backchannel calls)

# OA4MP Client

# The mp_client_id and mp_client_secret should be filled from the client ID and SECRET 
# provided by the delegation server while registering the master portal. Got to
# {{ delegation_server_auth }}/register and follow the registration steps to get an ID and SECRET

mp_client_id: MP_CLIENT_ID
mp_client_secret: MP_CLIENT_SECRET

# VO Portal

# The VO Portal is only deployed for testing purposes! Usually, a VO Portal would like on a different
# host. Leave these variables empty for the first run of ansible, since there is no Master Portal
# to register with yet. After the first ansible run, the Master Portal should be up and running. 
# Now you can naviagete to {{ masterportal }}/{{ mp_server }}/register and register your VO Portal.
# Once you have the ID and SECRET, you can fill them in here, and rerun ansible

vo_portal_id: VP_CLIENT_ID
vo_portal_secret: VP_CLIENT_SECRET

# Other generated secrets
