### OVERRIDDEN VALUES FOR THE credstore ROLE
########################################################################

### Trust anchors: for the credstore this MUST include:
### - CA for hostcert of masterportal, credstore and sshhost
### - OnlineCA (i.e. the backend CA for the online CA, typically RCauth)
### Settings here override also those in common_env.yml

### trust anchor as RPM
trust_anchor_packages:
  - "ca_TERENA-eScience-SSL-CA-3"
  - "ca_DCAROOT-G1"
  - "ca_RCauth-Pilot-ICA-G1"

### trust anchor as tarball
#trust_anchor_tarballs:
#  - "onlineca.tar.gz"
#  - "internalca.tar.gz"

### Additionally need IGTF distribution when we want to connect to VOMS servers.
### Probably only need classic for that
ca_policies_igtf:
  - ca_policy_igtf-classic

### Fill in the Master Portal DN. This is going to be trusted by the MyProxy
### Credential Store for proxy upload and retrieval. This is generally the
### hostcert DN of the Master Portal.
masterportal_credentials: "/C=NL/O=Example/OU=Org/CN=masterportal"

### Fill in the SSH Host DN. This is also going to be trusted by the MyProxy
### Credential Store. This is generally the hostcert DN of the SSH host.
### If the SSH host is not used or co-hosted with the Master Portal, this can be
### left out.
sshhost_credentials: "/C=NL/O=Example/OU=Org/CN=ssh-host"
